The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, `.parent .child` has higher specificity than `.child`, but the `!important` declaration in `.child` overrides it.  This can lead to unexpected behavior when you expect the more specific selector to win.  The `!important` flag is generally best avoided unless absolutely necessary due to its potential for creating difficult-to-debug conflicts.
