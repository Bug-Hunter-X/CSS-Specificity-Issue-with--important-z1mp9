To solve this, refactor the CSS to avoid the `!important` flag.  One possible solution is to adjust the order of selectors or adjust the classes used, prioritizing specificity appropriately. 

Here's an example of a solution:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this revised example, the specificity of `.parent .child` takes precedence, resulting in the expected green color.
