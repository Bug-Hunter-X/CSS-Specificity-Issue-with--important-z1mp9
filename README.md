# CSS Specificity and !important Conflict

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to specificity and the use of the `!important` declaration.  The bug showcases a situation where a more specific selector is overridden by an earlier `!important` declaration, leading to unexpected styling behavior.

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when a less specific selector has an `!important` declaration that conflicts with a more specific selector without `!important`.  The `!important` declaration takes precedence, regardless of specificity.

## Solution

The best solution is to avoid using `!important` whenever possible and instead restructure CSS to ensure that specificity rules resolve conflicts appropriately.  If `!important` is unavoidable, carefully review its implications on other parts of the stylesheet.  Using a CSS preprocessor with well-organized CSS can help reduce unexpected situations.
